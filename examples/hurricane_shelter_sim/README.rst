hurricane shelter simulation
============================

This simulation aims to assess how access to shelters is affected when shelters
become inaccessible. The simulation involves creating a large number of unique
scenarios in which each scenario involves removing a number of shelters from
the shelter pool, simulating them becoming inaccessible.
